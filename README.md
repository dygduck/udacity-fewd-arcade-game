# UDACITY Front-End Nanodegree Classic Arcade Game

In my Front End Udacity nanodegree, I had this project of a classic arcade game. The character has to pass through the grass and road and reach to the water without touching to the bugs who are passing through the road randomly. If the character touches to any bug, it directly goes back to the beginning point. After reaching the water, the character is again goes back to the beginning.


## Installing:

1. Clone the game from repo

2. Load index.html in browser.

3. Play the game


## How to Play:
The goal is to match is to reach to the water.

1. User has to use arrow keys on the keyboard in order to move up, down, left or right.

2. While moving through the water, user should avoid touching the bugs who are passing through randomly.

3. Once the user reaches to the water, or touches to any bug the position of the character sets back to the initial point.
